# Description

This sample show a basic tree view with Hubs, Projects, Folders and Items. It does not use the ASP.NET native [TreeView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.aspx) due its limitations, but the [jsTree](https://www.jstree.com/) library, that have support for menus, reload, among other features. This sample is based on the [Learn Forge](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) tutorial.

The tree view will display personal enterprise (shared) hubs, with respective projects. For Civil 3D drawings with Alignments, the **Alignment Design Check** toolbar icon list aligments and compare its curves with a minimum radius value. The following image demonstrate a tipical tree view:

# Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **BIM 360 Account**: (optional) must be Account Admin to add the app integration. [Learn about provisioning](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps).
2. **Forge Account**: Learn how to create a Forge Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](http://learnforge.autodesk.io/#/account/). 
3. **Visual Studio**: Either Community (Windows) or Code (Windows, MacOS).
4. **.NET Core** basic knowledge with C#
5. **JavaScript** basic knowledge with **jQuery**

## Running locally

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-viewhubs

**Visual Studio 2022** (Windows):

Right-click on the project, then go to **Debug**. Click on `Open debug launch profiles UI`. Adjust the settings as shown below.

Finally scroll down the same window to `enable SSL` and `Anonymous Authentication`. Make sure they are both checked.

**Visual Code** (Windows, MacOS):

Open the folder, at the bottom-right, select **Yes** and **Restore**. This restores the packages (e.g. Autodesk.Forge) and creates the launch.json file. See *Tips & Tricks* for .NET Core on MacOS.

**ngrok**

For webhooks service to send notifications to your localhost server, you may want to use ngrok. Check this link on [how to configure ngrok](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1/tutorials/configuring-your-server/). You can find more information on about ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com).

**Environment variables**

At the `.vscode\launch.json`, find the env vars and add your Forge Client ID, Secret and callback URL. Also define the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` variable. The end result should be as shown below:

```json
"env": {
    "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
    "ASPNETCORE_URLS" : "http://localhost:3000",
    "FORGE_CLIENT_ID": "your id here",
    "FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your secret here",
    "FORGE_CALLBACK_URL": "http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth",
    "FORGE_WEBHOOK_URL": "your ngrok address", e.g https://34e2-105-27-239-221.in.ngrok.io 
},
```

## Deployment

To deploy this application to Heroku, the **Callback URL** for Forge must use your `.herokuapp.com` address. After clicking on the button below, at the Heroku Create New App page, set your Client ID, Secret and Callback URL for Forge.

### Tips & Tricks

This sample uses .NET Core and works fine on both Windows and MacOS, see [this tutorial for MacOS](https://github.com/augustogoncalves/dotnetcoreheroku).

### Troubleshooting

1. **Cannot see my BIM 360 projects**: Make sure to provision the Forge App Client ID within the BIM 360 Account, [learn more here](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/bim-360-docs-provisioning-forge-apps). This requires the Account Admin permission.

2. **error setting certificate verify locations** error: may happen on Windows, use the following: `git config --global http.sslverify "false"`
